# Flips
Code and data availability for the article 'Flips reveal the universal impact of memory on random explorations'.
Folder 'simus' contains Python code to generate trajectories of models studied in the article.
Folder 'CodeSplittingSimus-alternative flip def' contains Python code to compute the flip probability under the alternative 'boundary-to-origin' definition of flips.
Folder 'flip-fractal' contains code to compute the flip probability for compact RWs on fractals (ie Sierpinski triangle / percolation cluster).
Folder 'flip-prob-2d' contains code to compute the flip probability for marginal and transient RWs.
Folder 'monkey' is an additional folder containing code to study the behavior of the monkey RW and its flip probability.
Folder 'Figures' contains the figures generated by the code in this repository, used in the article.
